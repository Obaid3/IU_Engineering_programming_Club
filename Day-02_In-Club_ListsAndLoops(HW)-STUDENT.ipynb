    "You recently attended a ball game game and started thinking about some of the mechanics of throwing a ball and whether or not you might be able to build a computational model to predict exact when a baseball will hit the ground based on the velocity it is throw with. For this problem, **you will assume that the ball is throw directly upward**. Since you're not sure exactly how fast you can actuall throw a baseball, **you're you going to compute several impacts times based on a range of initial baseball velocities**."

    "### The math behind the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a plan, you need to do a bit of digging to figure out how to compute the amount of time the baseball spends in the air based on the speed you launch it with. You spend a bit of time searching around on the internet, including Wikipedia, and you find that the important equation of motion is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = h_0 + v_0t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is the height of the ball as a function of time, $h_0$ is the initial height that the ball is launched from, $v_0$ is the initial speed the ball is launched with, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $t$ is the time in seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "You give it some further thought and realize what you want to know is when will the ball land, so **when does $h(t)=0$?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that the initial height that the ball is launched from, $h_0$, is roughly your height since you'll be throwing it, which we'll approximate as **1.75 meters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also recall that at some point you learned that the **acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s$^2$**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that all you need to do is **calculate the value of $t$ based on a range of initial values for the speed of the ball, $v_0$**.\n",

    "#### Potentially useful information:\n",
    "\n",
    "It might have been a while since you've see an equation that looks like the one above. It turns out that when $h(t)=0$, it's a **quadratic equation**, which looks something like:\n",

    "In general, before you start writing any code, it's good to get into the habit of coming up with a plan for how you've going to solve the problem. During this phase it is important to identify and define the variables that are revelant to the problem, the equations you're going to need to solve, and the overall structure of the program that you will write to solve the problem.\n",

    "To get some practice with this, you and your groups members are expected to **use paper** to come up with a plan for computing the impact time of the ball you're planning on throwing. Part of this planning process should involve a bit of what we commonly refer to as \"pseudo-code\". Pseudo-code is writing or text that follows the programmatic style of real code but doesn't necessarily have all of the proper syntax. You can think of it as an outline for how your program *should* work, before you actually start to code it up.\n",
