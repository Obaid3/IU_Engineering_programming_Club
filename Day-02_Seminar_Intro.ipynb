    "\n",
    "- Less is more: text and complicated graphics can distract your audience – you don’t want them to read your slide instead of listening to your 3MT. \n",
    "- Personal touches: personal touches can allow your audience to understand the impact of your research.\n",
    "- Creativity drives interest: do not rely on your slide to convey your message – it should simply complement your oration.\n",
    "- Work your message: think about how your slide might be able to assist with the format and delivery of your presentation – is there a metaphor that helps explain your research?\n",
    "- An engaging visual presentation can make or break any oration, so make sure your slide is legible, clear and concise."
