    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most widely used modern version control system in software industry and academia. Together with websites like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.msu.edu/), you can work on your project files anywhere with anyone with changes tracked so you can go back to earlier versions should there be issues and avoid conflicts.\n",

    "We will use GitHub in this class beause it has a much larger userbase and is fully integrated with VS Code. If you are interested in learning more, [here is an article discussing their simialrities and differences](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-vs-gitlab-the-key-differences/) (optional). "
